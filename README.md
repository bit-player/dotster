The aim is a space-filling algorithm that satisfies two rules:

1. There's always room for one more object.
2. As the number of objects goes to infinity,
       the space is fully covered.

A sequence of disks that satisfy these requirements comes from a certain range of zeta functions, based on the idea of summing the reciprocals of powers of integers.
